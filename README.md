# Animal Weight App

## How to start
1. Install Node.js (if there is a need)
   `https://nodejs.org/en/download/`
2. Clone project  
   `git clone https://github.com/SuvorovAlexey/animal-weight-app.git`
3. Install the Angular CLI
   `npm install -g @angular/cli`
4. Go to project folder
5. Install packages
   `npm i`
6. Run project in browser
   `ng serve --open`

## Notes about project
1. I used Angular and Angular Material in this project.
2. I thought what at weighting process input data in the stream can have different values (first more, then less due to various delays). I fixed it.
